## Project Description
This [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/s-sandra/sketches/c7eT53r2D) clock builds off the old adage “time is money,” representing system time in the style of a currency exchange board. The dollar amount attached to each country changes every second, depending on the nation’s yearly median household income (obtained from the [world population review](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/median-income-by-country/)). The rate of change is calculated by computing how much money an average citizen in that country makes each second, or dividing salary by the total number of seconds in the year. Therefore, countries with higher median earnings change at faster rates than countries at the end of the currency exchange board, whose values increment only every few seconds.
