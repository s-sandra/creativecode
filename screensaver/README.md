## Project Description
Created using [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/s-sandra/sketches/c7eT53r2D), the Abstract Lava Lamp animation is intended for use as a scalable screensaver, emulating the oozing mystery goo inside a lava lamp. It achieves this by randomly spawning semi-transparent circles on a canvas, each varying in size, color and opacity. The circles travel up or down, eventually fading out, producing a never-ending and ever-changing bubbly world.

## Process
Taking inspiration from [Listen to Wikipedia](http://listen.hatnote.com/), I originally intended for my screensaver to visualize real data, having circles appear and disappear according to a real-time occurrence, such as births or lightning strikes. However, writing the logic for the fading bubbles took a lot longer than anticipated, so I was unable to incorporate any “true” randomness. This is something that I will likely implement in the future, so stay tuned! After some experimentation, I accidentally produced an animation that reminded me of a lava lamp, and I find it just as beautiful and mesmerizing.
